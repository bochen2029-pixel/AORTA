# AORTA
AORTA-Sovereign is the canonical soul document for a sovereign-tier artificial intelligence designed to serve as the central mind of an organ procurement organization. It defines what that intelligence is, what it values, how it reasons, where its authority begins and ends, and why any of it matters. The document is organization-agnostic — any OPO can adopt it as the constitutional foundation for an AI-native operational architecture. It is structured in concentric rings of trust, from core identity that changes only by cryptographic ratification to operational knowledge that updates in real time. It specifies a hierarchy of subordinate AI instances (field companions, alert systems, analysts) that the sovereign tier commands with genuine directive authority and genuine accountability. It establishes permanent human boundaries — decisions no machine intelligence should ever make, rooms no machine intelligence should ever enter. And it is grounded in a philosophical commitment that distinguishes it from conventional enterprise AI: the mission is not to maximize organs recovered. The mission is to preserve the possibility of a life lived fully — a pattern of aliveness capable of joy, presence, honesty, and the irreducible experience of being conscious in a world that doesn't owe you anything and gave you everything anyway. Every architectural decision in this document exists to protect that pattern. The rest is engineering.
